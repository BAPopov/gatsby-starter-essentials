# Roadmap

The roadmap is a living document, and it is likely that priorities will change, but the list below should give some indication of our plans for the next major release, and for the future.

## Must-have features

- [ ] Update project's dependencies

- [ ] Use `mkitio@gatsby-theme-password-protect` to restrict access to the app on a global level as prerequisite of going live from Day One.

- [ ] Enable launch on Day One through CI/CD (like Netlify) and app-password-protection. Add `netlify.toml` file too.

- [ ] Skip `env.js` from loading `.env` if `NODE_ENV === 'production'`.

- [ ] TODO: Implement `replaceHydrateFunction()` into `gatsby-browser.js` as workaround for mismatching SSR and CSR MUI styles. See https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/17914.

## Nice-to-have features

- [ ] Submit to [Gatsby Starter Library](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/contributing/submit-to-starter-library/)
